## QUICK START

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnatchPugilist/mouzi-300.git
cd mouzi-300
python setup.py
```


> **Your downloads, tamed.**

Mouzi is a silent, elegant file organizer that lives in your system tray and keeps your Downloads folder (and any other folder) automatically tidy. It runs quietly in the background, monitors selected folders, and moves, renames, or sorts files based on customizable rules.

## ✨ Features

### 🔇 Silent by Default
- Runs 24/7 in the background with minimal resource usage (~5 MB RAM)
- Automatically organizes new files as they arrive
- Shows a subtle Windows toast notification with the count of organized files
- Silent autostart with Windows

### 📁 Smart Rules Engine
- **Images** (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`...) → `Downloads/Images/`
- **Documents** (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`...) → `Downloads/Documents/`
- **Archives** (`.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`...) → `Downloads/Archives/`
- **Installers** (`.exe`, `.msi`...) → `Downloads/Installers/`
- **Music** / **Video** → dedicated folders
- **Catch-all** rule for everything else

### 🛠️ Fully Customizable
- Create your own rules with extensions, regex patterns, and destination folders
- Use dynamic placeholders in paths: `{year}`, `{month}`, `{day}`, `{extension}`, `{filename}`
- Reorder rules by priority - first match wins

### 🚫 Ignore Rules (.mouziignore)
- Per-folder ignore patterns — like `.gitignore` for your files
- Set up via Settings UI or write a `.mouziignore` file manually
- Supports wildcards (`*.tmp`), exact names (`.DS_Store`), and folders (`node_modules/`)

### 📜 History & Undo
- Every action is logged locally in SQLite
- Undo any single move with one click
- Clear history anytime

### 🌍 Multi-language
Auto-detects your Windows system language. Supported:
- 🇬🇧 English
- 🇵🇱 Polish
- 🇮🇹 Italian
- 🇩🇪 German
- 🇫🇷 French
- 🇷🇺 Russian
- 🇯🇵 Japanese

*(Falls back to English if system language is not supported)*

### 🕶️ Dark Mode
- Follows system theme, or force Light / Dark mode from settings

### 🔒 Privacy First
- **100% offline** - zero cloud, zero file name uploads
- **No telemetry** by default
- **System files ignored** - `desktop.ini`, `Thumbs.db`, `.DS_Store`, and other OS hidden files are never touched
- **Portable version available** - run without installing, leaves no trace in the registry
- All data stored locally in your user profile folder

## ⚙️ How Rules Work

Rules are evaluated top-to-bottom. The first rule that matches a file wins.

| Condition | Example Match |
|-----------|---------------|
| Extensions | `jpg`, `png`, `gif` |
| Regex pattern | `.*faktura.*` matches `faktura_2025.pdf` |

**Destination path placeholders:**
```
Downloads/Documents/{year}/{month}/
→ Downloads/Documents/2026/05/
```
